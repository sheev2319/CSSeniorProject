The file stockfishWrapper.py defines how we interact with the Stockfish chess engine. main.py runs the simulations.

All other files involve reading the games and extracting the statistics. The file containing all the simulation game data, filtered_data.txt, was not able to be uploaded due to it being too large (stores information about 720,000 games).
